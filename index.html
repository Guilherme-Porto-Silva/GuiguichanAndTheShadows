<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
    The humanoid format of living being has only apeared once in the history of Earth, as all owners of it in the modern days are descendents of a spiecies in commun, and it took TIME, considering life has apeared when the planet was AGEEARTH old and SPIECIES TIMEAGO. In the Backrooms, though, there are LOTS of humanoid spiecies, wich does not make sents, because, if this shape where supoused to be so rare when the Frontrooms are looked, how did it apear so many times in the Backrooms? Many levels have helped us solving that incoherence, like level Fun =) with its gray water that hosts a virus, level 58 with its Underground and the sun that, somehow, shines underground, but is extremaly high the amount of levels that present shadowy humanoids, beings that are extremaly similar to us but are fully blacked out, sometimes beeing too tall or too slender. Backrooms level The Origen of Shadows is the one that came to anser why there are those shadows, it is the level that has shon to be capable of blacking out humans and change the way how they think to one that fits the actions of the shadowy humanoids seen around all Backrooms. It takes a very simple and repetitive apearence: near black dark purple soil, near black dark gray sky, not too big and very sparce crimison clounds, black and small grass, no trees and a hack of a lot of lakes made out of a variety of liquids, each one triggering a diferent change on those who, because they are the only source of hidration in the level, drink from them. Origen of Shadows does not ofer liquids that do not black out humans, reason why it is mandatory that one who entered it looks for an exit as soon as possible if they want to remain human, especialy if they did not bring their explorer's canteen with them. As an extremaly quiet level, it uses to be devoid of entitys, with the possibility of a person who drunk from a lake not too much time ago beeing found. Those might or might not be alredy showing the behavior of the entity they are turning into, beeing then recomended to wach out for them, as it is not known if stoping, slowing down or reverting the efects of drinking from a lake here is even possible.

        <h1>Events</h1>
<div class="party outlineStyle column">
    <h1>Party in Shadows</h1>
    <p>
        Happening completely rendomly, the event called Party in Shadows makes the sky of the level sudenly begin to release a bright red light, the clounds become lime and begin to rain confeti, ballons with color viriety clip into and float trough the air rondomly, the soil become yellow and the grass, orange. Tables apear and are fully party-themed decorated, as well as some random doors fixed on the soil, wich are direct conections to <a href="https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Level_Fun">level Fun =)</a> and apear to lure here the partygores who are there. You will know the event is close to its end when the partygores and people they just infected begin to fell lured back to Fun =) trough those doors by the way, and they are also an exit from this level, tecnically. A party music comes from God knows where during this event, never sounding closer or further.
